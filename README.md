## Hello there ðŸ‘‹!
I'm Undied, some of you may know me as Hemanth Chakka.

I am a student from India, I am mostly comfortable with TypeScript (and JavaScript ðŸ‘€), Svelte, Python and Zig. I've used a bit of Rust, Go and React.

Some of the projects i work on:
- [Tagger](https://github.com/SpecteraLabs/Tagger): A simple bot that creates custom tags programmable with TagScript.
- [pfcreator](https://github.com/UndiedGamer/pfcreator): A simple cli tool that helps me create practical lab files.
- [template-manager](): A WIP template-manager written in Go.
- [Attender](): Another WIP Attendance manager with sync support, written in NativeScript.
